## 💡 Why Prism?

A prism doesn't change light — it **reveals what was always there**.

Traditional recruiting tools see candidates as flat keyword lists. **Prism breaks that surface apart** — revealing true potential, career momentum, behavioral intent, and domain depth that keyword filters completely miss.

Just like a prism splits white light into its full spectrum, Prism splits a candidate profile into **5 distinct scoring dimensions** — giving recruiters a complete, multi-angle view of every person in their talent pool.

---

## 🧩 The Problem We Solve

Recruiters are drowning in profiles. Traditional AI tools:

- ❌ Match keywords, not meaning
- ❌ Give scores with zero explanation
- ❌ Treat a dormant 2-year-old profile the same as an active one
- ❌ Can't distinguish a rising star from someone who's plateaued
- ❌ Are fooled by AI-polished resumes
- ❌ Cost $250,000+ per year (Eightfold, HireVue)

**Prism fixes all of this in one open, explainable system.**

---

## ✨ Key Features & USPs

| Problem in Existing Tools | Prism's Solution |
|---|---|
| 🔴 Black box — no one knows why a candidate was rejected | ✅ **Glass Box Explainability** — every rank has an AI-written reason |
| 🔴 Keyword matching — misses semantic meaning | ✅ **Semantic Vector Search** — finds meaning, not just matching words |
| 🔴 Fixed scoring — can't adjust for role priorities | ✅ **Dynamic Weight Sliders** — recruiter controls what matters |
| 🔴 Ignores behavioral signals — dormant = active | ✅ **Intent Scoring** — recent activity boosts rank |
| 🔴 No career trajectory view | ✅ **Trajectory Momentum** — detects upward career velocity |
| 🔴 Enterprise-only pricing | ✅ **Open stack** — runs locally, zero licensing cost |
| 🔴 Fooled by AI-inflated resumes | ✅ **AI-Resistant Signals** — metadata ChatGPT can't fake |
| 🔴 Manual recruiter outreach | ✅ **Auto Outreach Drafts** — personalised messages for top 5 |

## 🔬 The 5 Scoring Signals — The Prism Spectrum

### ① Semantic Similarity (30%)
Vector embeddings find candidates who **mean** the right things — even with different words. "Drove top-line expansion" matches "revenue growth". Keyword search would miss this entirely.

### ② Skill Depth & Coverage (25%)
Not just "do they have it" but "how deeply?" Skills backed by multiple projects get a **1.2× credibility multiplier**. Skills listed with no evidence get **0.6×**. This is Prism's primary defense against AI-inflated resumes — ChatGPT can add skills to a resume but can't fabricate years of project history in metadata.

### ③ Career Trajectory (20%)
Analyses career history to detect upward momentum:
- Title progression (junior → senior → lead)
- Internal promotions — strongest performance signal
- Career velocity (seniority levels gained per year)
- Tenure health (fast-risers vs. job-hoppers vs. plateau)

### ④ Behavioral Intent (15%)
Answers **"are they actually looking right now?"** using metadata signals that cannot be faked:
- Days since last active (recent = high, dormant 18 months = low)
- Profile completeness ratio
- Recent skill additions
- Native platform activity score

### ⑤ Domain Relevance (10%)
Industry overlap between candidate history and the target role. Fintech candidate for fintech = 1.0. Adjacent industry (banking for fintech) = 0.65. Unrelated = 0.15. Never zero — transferable skills exist.

## 📊 Dataset Format

Place your CSV at `data/candidates.csv`. Prism has flexible column mapping — see `COLUMN_MAP` in `data_ingest.py` to adjust to your dataset's column names.

**Expected columns:**
```
candidate_id, name, email, current_title, current_company,
years_experience, skills, domain, last_active,
profile_completeness, career_history (JSON), education (JSON)
```

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

**Why SQLite instead of PostgreSQL?**
Zero installation, single file, fast enough for thousands of candidates. Swap to PostgreSQL in `database.py` for production — interface is identical.

**Why local embeddings instead of OpenAI?**
`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` runs on CPU in milliseconds with zero API cost. For 10,000 candidates, OpenAI embeddings cost ~$1. Prism runs free.

**Why 5 signals instead of one ML model?**
Interpretability. Each signal is independently explainable and tunable. A recruiter can say "trajectory matters most for this senior role" and move the slider. A black-box model can't offer that.

**Why weight behavioral signals?**
Research shows AI tools ignoring behavioral signals produce significantly higher 18-month attrition. A perfect resume from a dormant profile is worth less than a slightly weaker one from someone actively engaged.
